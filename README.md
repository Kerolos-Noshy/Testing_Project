# Online_Banking_System

## Overview
This is a group project for an Online Banking System, developed as part of a Software Testing course built with Java, creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX, and testing its functionalities with JUnit 4.

The main objective of this project is to design, implement, and test an online banking system that provides users with features for managing their bank accounts, performing transactions, paying bills, and providing payment and transaction history.


## Features 
- User Registration and Login: Users can create new accounts and securely log in using their credentials.
- Account Management: Users can view their account details, including balance and transaction history.
- Transactions: Users can perform various financial transactions, such as buying items, paying bills, and transferring money to other accounts.
- History: Users can view the history of their transactions and paid bills allowing them to show more details about it

## Unit Testing with JUnit 4

We have implemented unit tests using JUnit 4 to verify the behavior and correctness of individual functions within the system. These tests validate that the functions produce the expected results and handle various scenarios appropriately.

JUnit 4 allows us to define test methods with annotations and assertions, making it easier to write and maintain tests. Each test method covers specific functionalities to ensure that the system behaves as intended.

## Performence testing (`Speed testing`)
We have calculated the execution speed of each function and printed it by subtracting the time After execution and before execution.
